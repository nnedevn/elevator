Assumptions: 

There are ten floors in the building: Ground, 1, 2, 3, 4... 9. 
There is only 1 elevator servicing all ten floors. 
To traverse one floor level, takes the elevator 1 second. 
To embark or disembark passengers, stops the elevator for 3 seconds at a floor (simultaneous embarking and disembarking takes 3 seconds also).  


Requirements: 

Provide each floor with controls to call an elevator UP or DOWN. 
Ground floor only requires a call button for UP; 9th floor only requires a call button for DOWN. 
The elevator needs buttons to travel to all floors, they may be selected at any time, and multiple floors can be selected at once.
Create a graphical user interface to run the simulation. The GUI must include: 
-    A display for the current floor that the elevator is on.
-    A group of buttons representing the buttons located within the elevator, and which buttons are selected.
-    Call buttons for each floor, and which buttons are selected.
-    A display showing whether the elevator is headed up, down, or stationary at any given moment.
-    A visual queue when an elevator has arrived on a given floor.
